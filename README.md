## Deployment

### Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/)
3. Sign in with your GitHub account
4. Deploy your app by connecting to your repository
5. Set up any required secrets (like API keys)

### Required Secrets

For the weather functionality, you need an OpenWeatherMap API key:

1. Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Add it to your Streamlit secrets:
   - Locally: Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with:
     ```toml
     OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
     ```
   - On Streamlit Cloud: Add it in the app settings under "Secrets"

## Usage

### Available Commands

- **Time**: "What's the time?" or "Tell me the time"
- **Date**: "What's today's date?" or "Tell me the date"

## Differences from Desktop Version

This Streamlit version differs from the original desktop application:

1. **Voice Input/Output**: Using text-based input instead of microphone
2. **System Commands**: Cannot perform system operations (shutdown, restart)
3. **Browser Integration**: Opens links in new tabs rather than default browser
4. **Security**: Runs in a web environment with appropriate restrictions

## Future Enhancements

- Add voice input functionality using Streamlit Components with JavaScript
- Implement text-to-speech for responses
- Add more API integrations (news, reminders, etc.)
- Create a mobile-responsive design
- Add user authentication
